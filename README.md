# Rainbow paper implementation : 

This repository is inspired of the DeepMind paper:  Rainbow: Combining Improvements in Deep Reinforcement Learning, a paper that examines some extensions of the Deep Q-Networks algorithm and studies their combination on the Atari 2600 game. 

In the context of the Reinforcement Learning project of the Msc Data Sciences, some of these extensions are implemented and tested  on the LunarLander game.
